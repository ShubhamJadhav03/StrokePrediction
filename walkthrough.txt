Step 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
1.1 Load the Dataset
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
Display the first few rows using df.head() to get an initial view of the data.
1.2 Initial Exploration
Use df.info() to get an overview of the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, and data types.
Use df.describe() to get summary statistics for numerical columns.
Check for missing values using df.isnull().sum().
1.3 Handle Missing Values
Identify columns with missing values (e.g., bmi and smoking_status).
Impute missing values in the bmi column with the mean or median.
For smoking_status, you can either impute with the most frequent value or create a new category like "Unknown".
1.4 Encode Categorical Variables
Identify categorical columns (e.g., gender, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, smoking_status).
Use one-hot encoding to convert these categorical variables into numerical features. You can use pd.get_dummies() with the drop_first=True parameter to avoid multicollinearity.
1.5 Feature Scaling
Identify continuous features (e.g., age, avg_glucose_level, bmi).
Scale these features using StandardScaler to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance.
Step 2: Data Visualization and EDA
2.1 Visualize Data Distributions
Use histograms to visualize the distribution of continuous features (e.g., age, avg_glucose_level, bmi).
Use bar charts to visualize the distribution of categorical features (e.g., gender, ever_married, work_type).
2.2 Explore Relationships
Use boxplots to explore the relationship between categorical features and the target variable (stroke).
Use scatter plots or pair plots to explore relationships between continuous features.
2.3 Correlation Analysis
Compute the correlation matrix using df.corr() and visualize it using a heatmap to identify multicollinearity.
Step 3: Model Building
3.1 Split the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split with a test size of around 20% and a random state for reproducibility.
3.2 Create Pipelines
Create a preprocessing pipeline that includes imputation, encoding, and scaling.
Create a modeling pipeline that includes the preprocessing steps and the regression model.
3.3 Train Models
Train multiple regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.
Step 4: Model Evaluation
4.1 Evaluate Models
Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.
4.2 Fine-Tune the Best Model
Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model.
4.3 Validate the Model
Validate the final model on the test set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
Step 5: Interpretation and Insights
5.1 Feature Importance
Analyze the feature importances from models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to understand which features are most influential in predicting stroke risk.
5.2 Insights
Summarize your findings and insights from the analysis.
Discuss any potential biases or limitations in the dataset and how they might affect the modelâ€™s predictions.
Step 6: Deployment (Optional)
If you want to deploy the model, consider creating a simple web application using Flask or Streamlit.
Save the trained model using joblib or pickle for future use.
