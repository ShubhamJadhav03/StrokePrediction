# Stroke Prediction Using ML Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring using machine learning models. The dataset used includes various health parameters to train and evaluate the model.

## Language Composition
- Jupyter Notebook: 81.1%
- Python: 9.2%
- HTML: 5.6%
- CSS: 2.1%
- JavaScript: 2%

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model training.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `docs/`: Contains HTML documentation and reports.
- `static/`: Contains CSS and JavaScript files for the frontend.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamJadhav03/StrokePrediction.git
   cd StrokePrediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and train the models.
2. Use the Python scripts in the `src/` directory to preprocess data and evaluate models.
